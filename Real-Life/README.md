Andy Mikulski Sample Code
Work/Real-Life Projects
===

Here you can find samples I've produced while working full-time for [firstborn](http://www.firstborn.com/) and [Mondo Robot](http://www.mondorobot.com/). Each directory will have its own README to provide information for each sample.

## Firstborn
The `Firstborn` directory contains snippets of [http://www.firstborn.com/](firstborn.com), which I solely developed the front end using TypeScript.


## Mondo Robot
The `Mondo Robot` directory contains smaller utility modules developed while working on projects at [http://mondorobot.com/](Mondo Robot). They're a bit more proof-of-concepty, but should be fun to read through!
