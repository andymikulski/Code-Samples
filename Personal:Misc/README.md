Andy Mikulski's Sample Code
Personal Projects
============

These are some personal projects that I've built for fun or profit.


## Walt

My baby. Walt is essentially a JS wrapper for CSS3 animation events, utilized to animate websites and chain callbacks, etc. Since it's inception way back in ~2012, I've since buffed it up and rewritten it entirely into its current 2.x version.

Fun things to check out: Forking syntax, and the ability to merge two or more keyframed animations into one (on the fly).
