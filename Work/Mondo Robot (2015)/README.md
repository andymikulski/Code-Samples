Mondo Robot samples

Here you can find samples I've produced while working full-time for [Mondo Robot](http://www.mondorobot.com/) in Boulder, CO.

## Gretzky

A jQuery UI-based widget framework, complete with sample components you too could make with gretzky.js! Due to client needs, we were required to work within certain technical bounds. Gretzky was developed to leverage good stuff from $.ui while maintaining our sanity when building a complex, multi-component application.

## LaterGatorf

This is a fun one! String-based deferred/lazy loader, for when you need to lazy load a page but can't/don't want to change the markup coming from the server. It's a little smelly, but it's an interesting concept to explore!

## WinWin

Simple module to bind events to the Window, while throttling via requestAnimationFrame. Instead of defining a millisecond-based throttle, events only fire on animation frames, when the browser is ready. Simple concept, effective results.
